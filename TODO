- track card origin in TRADE_HAND or THIEF_STEAL so not moved in randomizeHiddenState

- implement one pass traversal for move generation
    - pass through hand to generate interest list
    - traverse model according to interests

- memory pool for move lists

- memory pool for mc search

- compare best point value per hand against winners (luck of cards wins every time?)

- inform rollout policy by limit horizon search
